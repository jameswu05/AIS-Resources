PyTorch offers two libraries to help load data

```torch.utils.data.DataLoader

and 

```torch.utils.data.Dataset

Programmers use dataloaders to keep their work organized. it is convention to
separate dataset code from your model's training code, as this makes the code
more modular and easier to read. Additionally, ```torch.utils.data.Dataset **has
pre-loaded datasets** to choose from. this can make the process of acquiring a
dataset very simple if something comparable is found in this library 

Let's dive into how these libraries work.
